  <h1>Privacy Policy — MOJA Labs</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> <span id="effective"></span></p>

  <p>
    MOJA Labs (“we,” “us,” or “our”) operates mobile applications and related services (the “Service”).
    This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the Service.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Personal information:</strong> We do not collect personal information such as your name, address, phone number, or precise location unless you explicitly provide it (for example, by emailing support).</p>

  <p><strong>Device and app information:</strong> The Service may process limited technical information needed to operate, such as device type, operating system version, and general app activity (for example, crash logs).</p>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and maintain the Service</li>
    <li>To improve reliability and performance (for example, fixing crashes)</li>
    <li>To respond to support requests</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    We may use third-party service providers to help us operate the Service (for example, analytics, crash reporting, or payments).
    These providers may process certain technical information to provide their services.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    If you use specific providers (e.g., Firebase, RevenueCat, etc.), list them here later for completeness.
  </p>

  <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>With service providers who help operate the Service (only as needed)</li>
    <li>If required by law, or to protect rights, safety, and security</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, contact us and we will delete it.
    Parents/guardians may contact us to request access or deletion.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain information only as long as needed to provide the Service and comply with legal obligations.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable safeguards designed to protect information, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the effective date above when changes are made.
